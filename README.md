This is a game inspired by Plants Vs Zomibes where the goal is to survive as long as possible.
The player will do this by gaining points they can use to place defences and use powerups.
While this is happening enemys aproach from the right of the screen and if they reach the left the player loses a life.
If the player loses all there lives the game ends.

Textures were created by the game art students we worked with

## How to Play

When the player has 200 points they can click the "Defender" button then click else where to place the defender

This will subtract 200 points

This will subtract 500 points, The player cannot have more than 3 Lives

When the player has 1000 they can click the "Nuke" button which will remove all enemys from the field
